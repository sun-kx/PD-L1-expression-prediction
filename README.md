# Multiple Instance Learning-based Prediction of PD-L1 Expression from H&E-stained Histopathological Images in Breast Cancer
This project is based on the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) method and predicts the expression of the PD-L1 gene by analyzing H&E (hematoxylin-eosin) stained slice images in histopathology.
